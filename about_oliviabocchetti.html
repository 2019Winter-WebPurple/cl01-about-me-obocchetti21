        <h1> About Me </h1><hr />
             
            <p> I was born in <b>Brooklyn, New York,</b> and lived in a Brownstone. I went to a school called Mandell, which was on the upper west side of<strong> Manhattan. </strong> My family and I moved to Delaware a little over four years ago becuase of my moms job. She is currently the Head of Lower School at Tatnall.</p><blockquote>I like Delaware but it is a very different way of living.</blockquote> 
        
            <p> I have two sibilngs, Lorenzo and Elena. Lorenzo is a Freshman at Conneticut College, in New London, and Elena is a Freshman at Padua. We all play soccer and run track. I am currently on the Padua track and soccer team. I also play for a travel soccer team called Delaware Rush.   </p>
         
            <p>This summer was on of my favorite summers. My family and I traveled to Italy to visit my dads parents. They live in a small town called, Scauri. It was very warm and the water was cristal clear. All my cousins also visited, so it was a like big family reunion. And lastly, my favorite book is <i>Night</i>, by Elie Wisel.  </p>
